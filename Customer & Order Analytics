-- Customer & Order Analytics Project
-- In this project, I analzye a customer order and sales database and answer the question below using quantitative methods



-- First evaluate data set to make sure there are not any anomalies 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
--- Cleaning the data to filter out blank values and incorrect order IDs
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
 
-- 1. How many orders were placed in January?
--SELECT count(orderID) as Num_of_Orders FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(Product) as Num_of_Orders, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND Product = 'iPhone';

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum, orderdate FROM BIT_DB.customers customers INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales sales ON customers.order_id = sales.orderID WHERE orderdate <> 'Order Date';

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


-- 5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT ROUND(SUM(quantity * price),2) as Total_Revenue, Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE Product <> '' AND Product <> 'Product' GROUP BY Product ORDER BY Total_Revenue; 

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, quantity, ROUND(SUM(quantity * price),2) as Total_Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location LIKE('548 Li%');

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum) as Num_Customers, AVG(quantity) * price FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers ON Feb.orderID = customers.order_id 
WHERE quantity > 2 AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; 

--  List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity) as Num_LA_Product FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location LIKE('%Los Angeles%') GROUP BY Product;
