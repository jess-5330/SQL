-- (*) Table names containing punctuation, capitalization, or spaces should be
--     quoted, e.g. "Test Data.csv".
-- (*) Add more data by using the Upload Data button.
-- (*) Create additional schemas for namespacing your tables, e.g. "CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;".
-- (*) When querying tables created outside of the public (default) schema,
--     be sure to specify the desired schema, e.g. "SELECT * FROM my_schema."my data.csv";".
